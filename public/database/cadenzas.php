				'p1' => 'Carl Stamitz (1745-1801), son of Johann and elder brother of Anton, was the most distinguished member of this noted musical family who were deeply associated with the Mannheim School of composition. He had a successful career as a solo violinist and orchestral director but his most important contribution has been as a composer for the viola, an instrument which he often played as a soloist all over Europe as part of his extensive concert touring. Other than this Viola Concerto in D, very few of his chamber, symphonic or concertante works are performed now but their influence upon his great contemporaries is undeniable, in spite of Mozart\'s scathing remarks about the Stamitz brothers in a letter to his father in 1778.',
				'p2' => 'Mozart was writing from Paris where Carl Stamitz had become established since 1770. The viola Concerto in D, Op.1 was composed during this period, no doubt for his own use as a piece to display his virtuosity, confirmed by the exploitation of multiple stopping, pedal notes, harmonics and even a left-hand pizzicato thereby anticipating Paganini by forty years.',
				'p3' => 'These cadenzas are constructed entirely from the text as published by Amadeus (BP 750, 1995) which is recommended as a thorough and scholarly edition prepared in the absence of an autograph of the solo part. Although some performance guidance is provided, it is anticipated that a performer would respond personally in the spirit of an improvisation, as was the practice of performers in the late eighteenth century, and that the chosen articulation in a performance would match that of the parallel passages in the Concerto.'

				'p1' => 'Franz Anton Hoffmeister (1754-1812) was a music publisher as well as a composer. He was a friend of both Haydn and Mozart, the latter dedicating his String Quartet in D K499 to him in recognition of his support in publishing several first editions.',
				'p2' => 'As a composer Hoffmeister was prolific, his works spanning virtually all genres from small scale chamber music through symphonies to opera. His music was admired during his lifetime for its melodic content and as models for study. Apart from the Concerto in D for Viola little of his music is now performed but this work has established itself as one of the principal classical concertos for the instrument.',
				'p3' => 'These cadenzas have been constructed from the composer\'s material as published by Kunzelmann (No. GM 701) in an edition prepared by Ulrich Drüner in the absence of an autograph. It is unfortunate that this scholarly attempt at revealing the composer\'s intentions has been undermined by the printing of several wrong notes (eg 3rd movement, bar 36.) Neverthless this edition is recommended as the basis for preparation of a performance and it is to this edition that the bar numbers at the beginnings and ends of the cadenzas apply. Only dots, instead of dots and wedges of the Kunzelmann Edition, have been employed for articulation indications as it is assumed that in performance the choice of bow stroke will match that chosen for the parallel passages in the concerto. Performance guidance has been provided but personal response is entirely appropriate in the context of what would have been an improvisation by the soloist.',

				'p1' => 'Mozart wrote the B flat major Violin Concerto, K207, in 1773 and the D major Concerto, K211, in 1775, probably for his own use. It is known that at this time Mozart was active as a violinist. Both works have been neglected although the "little" D major Concerto is occasionally played in public. One reason for their relative neglect may be the absence of readily accessible cadenzas especially as our increasing understanding of the 18th century performance practice demonstrates the need for improvisatory material at fermatas throughout the concertos in addition to the traditionally understood place at the ends of the first and second movements.',
				'p2' => 'These cadenzas have been constructed from Mozart\'s text as printed in the "Urtext of the new Mozart Edition" published by Bärenreiter. The bar numbers at the beginnings and ends of these cadenzas relate to the Bärenreiter editions which are strongly recommended as a reliable source for study and preparation.',
				'p3' => 'Although performance instructions are included, it is anticipated that the violinist will interpret these cadenzas with imagination and personal response, without necessarily following the dynamic and tempo markings. Articulation has been indicated by the use of dots rather than dots and wedges which are to be found in Bärenreiter texts. The degree and style of articulation in the performance of these cadenzas should relate to the way in which Mozart\'s passage work is played.',
